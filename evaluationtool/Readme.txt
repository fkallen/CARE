This program arteval is used to collect per-nucleotide correction metrics given 
the uncorrected reads, error free reads, and corrected reads. Reads must appear in the same order in every file.

artevalsmallercorrected additionally allows some reads to be missing in the corrected file. However, the read order must 
still be preserved.

Run make to build.
